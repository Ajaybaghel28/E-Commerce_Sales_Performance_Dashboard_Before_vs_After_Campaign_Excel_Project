# E-Commerce_Sales_Performance_Dashboard_Before_vs_After_Campaign_Excel_Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce marketing campaign and its impact on sales performance. By examining data from the months of August, September, October (the campaign month), November, and December, the analysis provides:

- Regional Sales Growth: Insights into how sales evolved across different regions.
- Product Category Trends: Identification of top-performing and underperforming product categories before, during, and after the campaign.
- Customer Demographics: Breakdown of customer behavior and purchasing patterns by age, income group, and other demographics.
- Return on Investment (ROI): Evaluation of the campaign's financial effectiveness across regions.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To assess sales growth by region and product category for different campaign periods.
- To analyze customer demographics (age and gender) across regions during the campaign period.
- To measure the ROI of the marketing campaign by region.
- To visualize the overall impact of the campaign on total sales.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Prior to building the dashboard, an EDA was conducted to gain insights into the data and identify any data cleaning needs.

### Data Cleaning:
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., region names and campaign periods) for consistency.
- Filtered out irrelevant data points and removed duplicate entries.

### Data Profiling:
- Sales Transactions: Analyzed the distribution of transaction dates, regions, and sales amounts.
- Marketing Campaign Data: Evaluated budget allocations across regions to understand the campaignâ€™s financial distribution.
- Customer Demographics: Examined age and gender distribution to understand the target customer base.

### Data Transformation:
- Aggregated sales data to create summary tables by region, product category, and campaign period.
- Created calculated fields such as ROI and Sales Growth Rate for insightful analysis.
- Joined sales, marketing, and customer data for a unified dataset used in the dashboard.

### Insights from EDA:
- Identified high-performing regions and product categories.
- Observed that certain age groups were more responsive to the campaign.
- Found that the data was sufficiently detailed to support targeted analysis in the dashboard.

## Data Sources
- Sales Transactions: Contains information on transactions before, during, and after the campaign.
- Marketing Campaign Data: Provides budget and marketing metrics for each region.
- Customer Data: Includes customer demographics like age, gender, and region.

## Dashboard Components
### 1. Filters

- Gender: Separate data by gender (Male, Female).
Region: Focus on specific regions (East, North, South, West).

### 2. Visualizations
#### Sales Growth by Region After Marketing Campaign
- Bar chart showing sales growth in each region (East, North, South, West) for each campaign period.
- Highlights regional performance improvements post-campaign.

#### Sales Growth by Product Category After Marketing Campaign
Bar chart displaying product category performance (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture, Home Appliances) across campaign periods.
Allows comparison of sales growth by product type.

#### Age and Gender Distribution of Campaign-Period Purchases by Region
- Stacked bar chart showing customer distribution by age group (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45+) and gender for each region.
- Provides insights into which demographics engaged most with the campaign.

#### Return on Investment (ROI) per Region
- Line chart illustrating ROI across regions.
- Highlights the regions with the highest and lowest returns from the campaign.

#### Sales Impact Analysis: Total Sales Before and After Marketing Campaign
- Donut chart showing total sales before and after the campaign.
- Visualizes the overall impact of the campaign on total sales, with values and percentages.

## Insights
- Regional Sales Growth: Significant sales increases in the South and West regions post-campaign.
- Product Category Performance: Home Appliances and Electronics saw the largest gains, indicating successful targeting.
- Demographic Engagement: High engagement from the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups across regions.

## Conclusion
This dashboard provides valuable insights into the marketing campaign's effectiveness in driving e-commerce sales. It enables stakeholders to assess campaign impact by region, product, and demographics, informing future campaign strategies.

## Future Improvements
- Additional Metrics: Include metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
- Dynamic Date Filters: Enable more flexible date-based filtering.
- Subcategory Analysis: Refine product analysis by examining subcategories for deeper insights.
